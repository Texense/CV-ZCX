\makerubrichead{Research Interests}
I combine modern data-driven methods and conventional ideas of model reductions to understand how brain functions emerge from complex dynamics of neuronal populations. I am also interested in mathematical questions arising from simulations and analysis of spiking networks.

{\bf Specific Research Items} \\
- Efficient computational models of the visual cortex. \\
- Model reductions for coherent, oscillatory cortical dynamics.\\
- Reliability of numerical simulations of spiking networks.
